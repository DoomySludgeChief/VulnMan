# Vulnerability Management in 4 Steps
A quick rundown of the steps

Vulnerability Management in 4 Stages
Introduction
Vulnerability management is a continuous process involving tools, collaboration, and procedures to identify, prioritize, remediate, and verify security issues in your organizationâ€™s assets. Here are the key stages:

Asset Scanning: Regularly scan all organizational assets using various tools to detect vulnerabilities.
Prioritization: Evaluate and prioritize the findings based on risk and impact.
Remediation: Collaborate with relevant teams to address and fix identified vulnerabilities.
Verification: Confirm that remediation efforts are effective through rescanning and continuous monitoring.
Detailed Breakdown
1. Asset Scanning
Use diverse tools for comprehensive scanning, including:
SAST (Static Analysis Security Testing): Scans code for vulnerabilities.
DAST (Dynamic Analysis Security Testing): Checks running applications.
SCA (Software Composition Analysis): Examines open-source components.
Network Vulnerability Scanning: Analyzes networked devices and servers.
IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing): Combines runtime and source code analysis.
Penetration Testing: Simulates real-world attacks to find exploitable vulnerabilities.
2. Prioritization
Use CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) to rank vulnerabilities.
Consider business impact, asset criticality, and potential risks when prioritizing.
3. Remediation
Engage with development, operations, and security teams to patch or mitigate vulnerabilities.
Understand the operational challenges and ensure empathetic communication.
4. Verification
Re-scan assets to ensure vulnerabilities are resolved.
Implement continuous scanning for ongoing security assurance.
Conclusion
Effective vulnerability management requires thorough asset management, continuous scanning, clear prioritization, and collaborative remediation. Building strong relationships with cross-functional teams is crucial for success.
