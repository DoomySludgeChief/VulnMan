# Vulnerability Management in 4 Stages

### Introduction

In the wild world of cybersecurity, vulnerability management is like playing whack-a-mole, but the moles are invisible and can potentially bring down your entire operation. Let’s break down this four-ring circus:

1. **Asset Scanning**: Unearth those pesky vulnerabilities lurking in your assets.
2. **Prioritization**: Decide which vulnerability is the biggest bully.
3. **Remediation**: Fix it before it fixes you.
4. **Verification**: Double-check your work because nobody likes a false sense of security.

### Detailed Breakdown

**1. Asset Scanning**

- **SAST**: Think of it as a detective in your code.
- **DAST**: This one checks if your app is misbehaving while running.
- **SCA**: Analyzes the open-source party crashers in your software.
- **Network Vulnerability Scanning**: Ensures your network isn't a free-for-all.
- **IAST**: A spy who watches your application’s every move.
- **Penetration Testing**: Ethical hackers trying to outwit you; think James Bond but with more coffee.

**2. Prioritization**

- Use CVSS scores to figure out which fire to put out first.
- Consider what’s most critical to your business—your boss's email or the server storing all your client data. Choose wisely.
- Take into account the exploitability of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Involve stakeholders to understand the business context and risk appetite.

**3. Remediation**

- Work with your team to patch things up. Remember, you catch more flies with honey than vinegar—or in this case, you get more cooperation with clear communication.
- Balancing the need to fix issues and the inevitable grumbling from ops because "this wasn't in the sprint plan!"
- Implement temporary mitigations if immediate full remediation isn't possible.
- Document the remediation process and lessons learned for future reference.

**4. Verification**

- Re-scan to make sure the vulnerabilities have truly taken a hike.
- Continuous scanning is like a daily vitamin—keeps things running smoothly and avoids nasty surprises.
- Perform manual testing for critical issues to ensure they are properly fixed.
- Review the effectiveness of your vulnerability management process and make improvements as necessary.

### Conclusion

Vulnerability management is a marathon, not a sprint. It requires constant vigilance, a touch of paranoia, and a lot of teamwork. Remember, the security team is your friend, not your enemy. Keep scanning, keep fixing, and always verify because, in cybersecurity, it’s better to be safe than sorry (or hacked).
